# Bears In Canada Project (SQL & ERWIN)

## Overview

I have just won the contract to design and implement a prototype database for the Bears In Canada Project - BIC project. I have been selected as the DA (Data Architect) for this project. The motivation for this project is to keep a record of what is going on in various research studies involving bears where samples are located by telemetry, hair snags, and scat located by specially trained canines (dogs).

The motivation for the project is declining populations of bears. The project is about tracking the location and health of bears in or near a national park in Canada. 
## **Tracking is done by three different methods:**
- `Telemetry`: Tracking (after a bear has been captured and a tracking device has been attached)
- `Hair snags`: Found on bushes and trees in the area
- `Scats (animal feces)`: Located by specially trained dogs. 
DNA data from hair and scat samples can be used to determine the sex of the bear and some health data. The seat samples provide individualized data on the physiological health of that animal.

There are many regions in which studies are being conducted. Three regions are to be part of the test data: North Region (NR), Central Region (CR) and South Region (SR) (see diagram).
Regions are divided into cells (which are numbered) and a x, y position location within a cell.
